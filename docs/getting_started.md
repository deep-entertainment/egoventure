# Getting started

*EgoVenture* is a framework for creating first person point and click games. It handles and streamlines the most basic stuff and makes it easy to develop games like this.

Usually, the games need two more plugins to fully function:

* Speedy Gonzales - custom mouse cursor handling

* Parrot - voice dialog handling

To easily get started making an *EgoVenture* game, it's recommended to use the *EgoVenture Game Template*. This template includes all required plugins, a default game configuration, a basic game state and initialization code and the recommended folder structure to get started right away.

FIXME Add tutorial with game template.
