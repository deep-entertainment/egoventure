## Configuration

*EgoVenture* tries to streamline, standardize and speed-up game development progress and at the same time customize most of the game's aspects.

To be able to easily update to new versions of *EgoVenture* it is **not recommended** to change the sources of the addon itself and rather use the game configuration or [theming](theming.md).

If you can't customize a specific aspect, please file an [issue with us](https://github.com/deep-entertainment/egoventure/issues) and tell us what you need.

See the [Api-Doc of the GameConfiguration](api/GameConfiguration.md) resource type for available configuration options.
